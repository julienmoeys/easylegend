VERSION 1.4.1

    2016/06/08  Fix a bug in setFactorGraphics.default()
        The values were ordered, but not the colours, fills 
        or pch associated with the values, causing inconsistent 
        legend compared to user specification.
    
VERSION 1.4.0
    
    2016/03/23  setColourRampScale(), setColourScale() and 
        setColorScale() now account for cases where the input 
        values for which the legend is to be created have 
        only one unique value (also when this value is 0), 
        and will give an error if there are only NA or NaN 
        or infinite values.
    
VERSION 1.3.0

    2015/05/29  Implemented two new functions: 
        setColourScale() and setColourRampScale().
        These functions improve and superseed setColorScale(), 
        especially for colour gradients with intermediate 
        colours, where setColorScale() did not show a good 
        gradient nearby the min and the max values of the 
        scale.
    
VERSION 1.2.6

    2015/05/22  Attempt to fix a bug in setColorScale() 
        that outputs fill-colors in the wrong order 
        (but in the right order for iFill and iBreaks)
